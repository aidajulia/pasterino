# pasterino

A pastebin like webservice written in Java using [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) &amp; [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/) for the frontend and [Redis](http://redis.io) &amp; [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) for the backend.

You need a redistogo instance to run this application. Change the REDIS_PASSWORD and REDIS_URI accordingly.

This project now only runs from a .jar file.
